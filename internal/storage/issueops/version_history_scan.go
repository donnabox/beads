// FindUnversionable runs CheckIssueVersionable over every issue in issues that
// the mint would version and returns the ones it refuses, in the order they were
// given. It is the core of the check made when versioned history is switched on:
// with history on, a write that introduces a value the mint refuses aborts in its
// own transaction, but a row that already holds one -- written while history was
// off, or by a path that does not mint -- would fail every later write to it. The
// check is over the whole issue, as the mint's is, and not over its metadata
// alone: a gate's timeout past 2^53-1 nanoseconds is refused too.
//
// It skips the rows the mint never versions by IsWisp: ephemeral and no-history
// rows are never versioned, so a value they hold can never abort a write. It
// cannot skip legacy rows, because participation is not on types.Issue, so on a
// store with the write fence (design §16.2b) it is a deliberate
// over-approximation: the mint skips a legacy row whatever it holds, and this
// still refuses over it, which is the safe direction because it can only refuse
// more. It does no I/O; the caller loads the rows, which is what lets one
// function serve the direct store and the proxied route.
