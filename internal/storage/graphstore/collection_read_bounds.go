// PreviewCurrentReadByteLimit is a conservative acquisition budget for the

// informational rows (including corrupt orphans) are charged. It counts persisted bytes with repeated owner/Link acquisition and 256 bytes

// restriction or an exact Go heap/SQL-engine memory bound. Historical revisions
// which are not current are neither acquired nor charged.
